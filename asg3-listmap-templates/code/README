We are working together doing pair programming.
 All of the work submitted here is code written by us,
 except for code copied from the instructor's directories. 

We both have read understood the UC Santa Cruz Academic 
Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates. 
https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair is 
responsible for the work performed by the other partner, 
and all work has been reviewed by both partners working 
together. Both of us know the format of the PARTNER file. 

Please grade from Warner Scheibe's (wscheibe) submission.
